                the
                Privacy Statement.</p>

            <p>1.2 Password Security. You are responsible to keep your password(s) secure, and you agree not to disclose
                your
                passwords to any third party. You are solely responsible for any activity that occurs under your user
                names

                being
                confidential, or which is otherwise disclosed in such a manner or is of such a character as would put a

                person on notice as to the confidential and proprietary nature of the information (collectively, the

            <p>1.4 Disclosure Under Compulsion of Law. In the event you are the recipient of any court order, subpoena
                or
                other
                governmental authority which purports to require the disclosure of any of the site-name’
                Confidential
                Information, or in the event such disclosure is required by applicable law, regulation or stock exchange
                rule, you
                shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide the site-name with prompt notice of the
                same prior
                to any disclosure and with such advance notice so as to afford a reasonable opportunity to protect the
                Confidential
                Information from public disclosure, and shall construe any such court order, subpoena or other
                governmental
                authority requesting such information in the narrowest permissible manner and shall seek to obtain and
                cooperate
                with site-name to obtain a proper protective order, a court ruling quashing any such subpoena,
                or any
                other governmental or private mechanism for retention of the confidential status of the information
                sought.</p>
